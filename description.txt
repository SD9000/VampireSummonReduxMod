This mod is a small commission I did for someone. It includes one weapon - a summoner version of the Vampire Knives.
The weapon summons knives that revolve around the player when idle and jab at enemies. There's a chance for lifesteal to occur.

The main feature of the mod is that the weapon is upgradeable in 5 different categories throughout your playthrough: Damage, Speed, Lifesteal Amount, Lifesteal Chance, and how often the knives attack.

Stats can be upgraded with experience earned by dealing damage. The cost to buy upgrades increases with the number of upgrades bought.
There is also a damage cap for hardmode and Moon Lord - these along with the base upgrade cost are configurable.
